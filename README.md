# Maze Game

## Overview

The Maze Game is a simple maze navigation game where the player must find their way from the start (top-left corner) to the endpoint (bottom-right corner) while avoiding obstacles. The game includes a timer, score tracker, and multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

## Features

- **Timer**: The game includes a timer that tracks how long it takes the player to complete the maze.
- **Score**: The player's score is based on the time taken to complete the maze, and it decreases as time passes.
- **Difficulty Levels**: There are three levels of difficulty:
  - **Easy**: A relatively simple maze with fewer obstacles.
  - **Medium**: A more challenging maze with increased complexity.
  - **Hard**: A complex maze with many obstacles and a higher challenge.
- **Maze Generation**: The maze is represented as a 2D grid, with walls (1s) and open paths (0s).
